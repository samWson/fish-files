# Fish Files

These are my custom functions and configuration for the Fish shell.

## Usage

This repository is for developing and maintaining fish files. To use them copy
them or create a symbolic link to them in the appropriate directory:
- Autoloading functions: `~/.config/fish/functions/`
- Shell initialization:  `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

### Example

Create a symbolic link of `fishy_function.fish` as an autoloading function:
```shell
> ln -s fishy_function.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/fishy_function.fish
```
